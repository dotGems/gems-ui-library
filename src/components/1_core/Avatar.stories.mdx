# Text Input
The text input is very flexible and has some cool features but this comes at a cost which I will talk about.

export const Template = (args) => <Avatar {...args}/>

A very simple input would look like this. It renders a single input element with no extra processing.

<Story name="Text">{Template.bind({})}</Story>

But then we can take it further and although this renders the same thing, if there is nothing in the input, it will have a red border! You can also pass `errorWait` as true to make it only turn red once the user has altered the value in some way.

<Story name="Not Empty" args={{
    notEmpty: true
}}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>

This starts becoming useful when we need to make inputs like usernames. You can't log in if you don't have a username!

<Story name="Username Example" args={{
    notEmpty: true,
    placeholder: "Username",
    autoComplete: "username",
    mode: "text"
}}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>

This will also work with things like emails because there is another property called errorLabel which acts the same way as the border except obviously is a bit of text that tells you why its gone red.

<Story name="Email Example" args={{
    notEmpty: true,
    placeholder: "Email",
    autoComplete: "email",
    mode: "email",
    errorLabel: true
}}>{Template.bind({})}</Story>
