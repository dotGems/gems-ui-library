            description: "Merijn Kavelaars is an internationally celebrated artist from the Netherlands, known for his unique artistic language, action-loaded murals and colourful paintings. He won the Stolichnaya art contest and his physical works are in private collections all over the world.\nMarijn conquers spaces, creating works that merge site-specific installation, painting and sculpture. And with the same playful enthusiasm, he now enters the NFT space, to experiment with the opportunities provided by this new medium.\nHe describes the intention behind his artistic practice as “creating a world where he can get lost in,” so diving into the NFT rabbit hole comes quite naturally to him. And lucky for us, this process is documented in some unique and beautiful digital art pieces.\nSimilar to his room installations, he uses different elements and formats for his Genesis NFT drop. Expressing movement and diversity. It features an animated version of one of his large-scale canvases and 3D sculptures.",
